#Tasks/Features/Bugs

#Task
- Read Java coding standards
- Add something like sonar for code quality
- Add vulnerability scan
- ~~Add logging~~
- See how the program works on another PC and with a different resolution
- Instruction for adding debug/source libraries for debugging IcePDF and other
  dependencies.
- Change (to proper) design patterns

#Features
- Annotating in the PDF to focus on certain aspects. Possibly annotating other
  words in another color to skip them in use for the renaming.
- Configuration: Change prompts from config screen
- LLM support for refining queries
- History for field with current selected rename option.
- Save window layout (like where the split pane is positioned)
- Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for naming in ways similar for
  documents with similar content
- Using other AI deployment/management applications than Ollama

#Bugs
- There is an issue with IcePDF that causes fit to screen issues after opening
  a PDF after another. The (in code) selected way of fitting is changed to 90%
  zoom level
