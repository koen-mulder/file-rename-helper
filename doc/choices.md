#Choices#

Here I am logging some basic choices and the reasoning behind them.

##Programming language##

I've chosen to use Java for this project to refresh my knowledge of the language.'

##IDE/Editor
The project should be compatible with any IDE or editor. Personally, I'm using Eclipse because I’m familiar with it, it’s free, and it's more than just an editor. It also has GitHub Copilot integration, and I want to see if that tool is useful for me.
