# Choices

Here I am logging some basic choices and the reasoning behind them.

## Programming language

I've chosen to use Java for this project to refresh my knowledge of the language.

## IDE/Editor

The project should be compatible with any IDE or editor. Personally, I'm using Eclipse because I’m familiar with it, it’s free, and it's more than just an editor. It also has GitHub Copilot integration, and I want to see if that tool is useful for me.

## PDF viewer

Won't use Apache PDFBox (3.0.4) was very slow loading PDF files. Using IcePDF because it is faster.

## Version numbering

I'll be following Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 just because it is a widely used versioning scheme. See [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/) for more information.

## Swing/JavaFX

I initially choose Swing because I have some experience with it and it is part of the JDK. I read that JavaFX was taken out of the JDK so I understood that as "don't use it". But it was actually for several interconnected reasons, primarily revolving around modularity, maintainability, and the evolution of the Java platform.

For now I'll keep using Swing because I want to go ahead and as soon as I can make a usable version. I don't want to get stuck in this details too much and prefer to put my focus on using design patterns correctly.
